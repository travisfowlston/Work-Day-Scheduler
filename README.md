## Comments

- Added the current date and time to the header using day.js.
- Created time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm.
- The time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- Each time block can have an event added to it and can be saved to localStorage.
- When the page is refreshed, the saved event will persist.
